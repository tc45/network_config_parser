# Parser Architecture

## Technology Stack
Technology stack for parser implementation:

- ntc-templates: Core parsing library replacing custom regex
- Pydantic: Data validation and standardization across vendors
- Django ORM: Data persistence with proper model integration
- Celery: Background processing for large files
- DRF: API endpoints for parser functionality

## Current Architecture
The current parser implementation:
- Uses CiscoConfParse2 for Cisco devices
- Has custom parsing logic for different device types
- Extracts data from show tech files using regex patterns
- Outputs data to Excel files or console tables
- Operates as a CLI tool with manual file selection

## Future Architecture
The future parser will:
- Use ntc-templates for standardized parsing
- Implement Pydantic models for data validation
- Store parsed data in a database for persistence and comparison
- Support multiple iterations (versions) of device configurations
- Provide a web interface for data visualization
- Enable direct device connectivity via SSH and APIs

## Parser Integration
The parser integration will include:
- Adapter classes for different device types
- Command mappers for extracting specific outputs
- Transformation utilities for standardizing data formats
- Background processing for handling large files
- Progress tracking and notification
