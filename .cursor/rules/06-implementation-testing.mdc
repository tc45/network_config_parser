# Implementation and Testing Strategy

This rule outlines the testing and implementation approach for the Django network configuration application.

## Testing Framework
The application will use a comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit tests for all components using pytest
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- UI tests using Selenium
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Security testing for authentication and data protection

## Test Fixtures and Factories
The testing infrastructure will include:
- Sample device configuration files for all supported vendors
- Test fixtures and factories for database objects
- Mocking for external services and connections
- Coverage reporting to ensure complete test coverage

## Example Test Cases
`python
# Test user registration
def test_user_registration():
    response = client.post('/accounts/register/', {
        'username': 'testuser',
        'email': 'test@example.com',
        'password1': 'complex_password',
        'password2': 'complex_password',
    })
    assert response.status_code == 302  # Redirect after registration
    assert User.objects.filter(username='testuser').exists()

# Test parsing show interfaces output
def test_parse_show_interfaces():
    with open('tests/sample_data/cisco_ios_show_interfaces.txt', 'r') as f:
        output = f.read()
    
    result = parse_device_output(platform='cisco_ios', command='show interfaces', output=output)
    assert len(result) > 0
    assert 'interface' in result[0]
`

## CI/CD Pipeline
The application will be supported by a CI/CD pipeline:
- Automated testing on each commit
- Code quality checks (flake8, black, isort)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Automated deployment to staging environment
- Production deployment process

## Implementation Phases
The implementation will follow the phased approach in [docs/FUTURE/implementation_plan.md](mdc:docs/FUTURE/implementation_plan.md):
1. Project Setup and Initial Framework
2. Parser Implementation
3. Django Web Interface
4. Advanced Features
5. Testing and Refinement
