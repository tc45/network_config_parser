# Network Configuration Parser - Future Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level roadmap for transforming the current Network Configuration Parser into a robust, scalable Django-based application capable of handling multiple vendors, device types, and use cases. The primary goal is to move from a command-line based parsing tool to a full-featured web application that supports collaborative workflows, complex data analysis, and comprehensive network documentation.

## Core Architectural Changes

### 1. Move from CLI to Django Web Application
- Transition from command-line tool to a full-featured web application
- Implement Django for front-end and back-end functionality
- Set up a flexible database model (SQLite initially, designed for PostgreSQL migration)
- Create a responsive, dashboard-driven UI for better user experience

### 2. Parser Implementation Changes
- Replace custom parsing logic with ntc-templates library
- Implement a modular approach to parsing different device outputs
- Standardize data structures using Pydantic models
- Create adapters for vendor-specific parsing logic

### 3. Multi-user Collaboration Features
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Support customer and project management
- Enable sharing capabilities between users
- Implement role-based access control

### 4. Data Management Enhancements
- Store and manage parsed configurations
- Support multiple iterations of device configurations
- Enable diff/comparison between configuration versions
- Implement flexible data export options (XLSX, CSV, PDF)

### 5. Device Support Expansion
- Initially focus on Cisco IOS, NXOS, ASA
- Add support for Palo Alto, Arista EOS, Juniper, Fortinet
- Implement modular architecture for easy addition of new vendors
- Standardize data models across different device types

### 6. Interface Collection Enhancements
- Add direct SSH connection via Netmiko
- Implement API-based collection for platforms like Meraki
- Create flexible command template system for device data collection

### 7. Containerization
- Package application in Docker for easy deployment
- Create a standardized environment for consistent operation
- Support both centralized and on-premises deployment options

## Vendor-Specific Enhancements

### Firewall-Specific Capabilities
- Enhanced parsing for access-lists, object-groups, crypto maps
- NAT translation analysis and visualization
- Security policy review and assessment tools
- Configuration optimization recommendations

### Switch/Router Capabilities
- Interface status and configuration analysis
- Routing table analysis and visualization
- Discovery protocol (CDP/LLDP) mapping
- VLAN and trunk configuration management

## Performance and Scalability Considerations
- Implement asynchronous processing for large configuration sets
- Create efficient indexing for quick searches across large datasets
- Design for horizontal scalability in production environments
- Optimize database queries for performance

## Security Features
- Secure storage of credentials and device access information
- Role-based access controls for sensitive data
- Audit logging of user actions
- Configuration data sanitization capabilities
