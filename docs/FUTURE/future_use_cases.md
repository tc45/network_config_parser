# Future Use Cases

This document outlines potential future use cases for the Network Configuration Parser application, beyond the core functionality planned for initial release.

## Natural Language Processing Integration

### Conversational Interface for Network Data
The application will integrate natural language processing capabilities to allow users to interact with their network data through a conversational interface.

**Example Queries:**

- "Compare the routing tables between router-1 and router-2"
- "Generate a report of all access ports with high utilization"
- "List all firewall rules that allow traffic to the internet"
- "Show me which devices have outdated IOS versions"

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Integration with LLM models (local or API-based)
- Custom training on networking terminology and concepts
- Query parsing and intent recognition
- Data retrieval and formatting systems
- Response generation with visualizations
- Integration with existing data models

**Benefits:**
- Simplified access to complex network data
- Reduced learning curve for new users
- Faster insights for experienced engineers
- Generation of customized reports on demand
- Potential for automated recommendations

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Graph database integration for relationship mapping
- Interactive visualization libraries
- Automatic layout algorithms
- Manual adjustment capabilities
- Integration with IP/MAC address correlation
- Export to documentation formats

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive visual understanding of network architecture
- Simplified troubleshooting through visual navigation
- Better documentation for complex environments
- Easier identification of redundancy or single points of failure
- Enhanced communication with non-technical stakeholders

## Security Posture Assessment

### Automated Security Analysis and Recommendations
The application will analyze network device configurations to assess security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements.

**Assessment Capabilities:**
- Firewall rule analysis and optimization
- Unused or overly permissive access rules identification
- Security best practices compliance checking
- Vulnerability identification based on configurations

The application will provide capacity planning tools that analyze historical data and predict future resource requirements.

**Planning Capabilities:**
- Interface utilization trend analysis
- Growth prediction based on historical patterns
- "What-if" scenario modeling
- Bandwidth requirement forecasting
- Resource constraint identification
- Upgrade and expansion planning

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Integration with time-series data collection
- Statistical analysis and trend detection
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Visualization of growth trends
- Integration with procurement systems
- Cost modeling and TCO analysis

**Benefits:**
- Data-driven infrastructure planning
- Proactive identification of capacity constraints
- More accurate budgeting for network resources
- Reduced risk of performance degradation
- Optimized capital expenditure

## Compliance and Audit Support
